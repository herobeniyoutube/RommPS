/* Saves made of several files, synced as one zip per game, in the layout of
 * RomM's own save units (rommapp/argosy-sigil), so other clients take them:
 *   psp   PSP/SAVEDATA/<game id>*  folders (PPSSPP); each folder by its name
 *   gci   GC/<region>/Card A/ .gci files with the game id (Dolphin)
 *   wii   Wii/title/00010000/<id>/  folder (Dolphin), as "<id>/..."
 *   3ds   title/<high>/<low>/data/00000001/ (Azahar), as
 *         "<high>/<low>/data/00000001/..." and its 00000001.metadata
 *   wiiu  usr/save/<high>/<low>/ (Cemu), as "<low>/meta/...",
 *         "<low>/user/common/..." and this console's account folder as
 *         "<low>/user/account/..."
 *   ps2   the game's save folders on the slots' PCSX2 folder cards, or a file
 *         card holding its saves; synced as sigil's one-game card (ps2card.h),
 *         not a zip. Its bases are the slot cards themselves.
 * Ids: the disc's "GALE01", a PS2 serial "SLUS-21059", or a 3DS or Wii U title "0004000000066C00". A
 * zip from elsewhere is taken in other forms too (no root folder, Cemu's own
 * export, the whole path from the SD card). */
