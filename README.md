# RomM Server Client for PS4 and PS5

![Project Screenshot](assets/library.png)

A [RomM](https://romm.app) companion client for jailbroken PS5 consoles (etaHEN or onionHEN, with kstuff) and PS4 consoles (GoldHEN). Through my insatiable need to mod everything electronic I encounter, I had my 12.70 PS5 jailbroken the minute that P2JB was out. I maintain a RomM server to centralize all my _legal_ ROMs, saves, and savestates, which all my devices sync with, and the PS5 needs similar treatment.

- **Save and state sync**
  - Monitors save file changes in the background, and uploads them as soon as they've changed. Periodic syncs also ensure that your PS4/5 always has the latest saves and save states.
  - A game's saves come down the moment it finishes downloading, so it's ready to play.
  - Save states only come down to an emulator that can load them (see [Save states](#save-states)).
  - Optional: turn save sync off in setup or Settings to use RomM just for games.
- **See what synced**
  - An activity log and every save and state kept in sync, by platform, in the app and the Web UI. Settle conflicts and restore older versions from either.
  - Settings > Diagnostic bundle saves the logs for a bug report, with your server, names and addresses left out.
- **Interactive library**
  - Browse your RomM library from the RommPS app (or some other device via the Web UI), download games and BIOS files into the right emulator folders, and resolve save conflicts.
- **Pluggable emulator profiles and multiple emulators per platform**
  - Fully customizable sync destinations, but includes frequently updated preset profiles for existing homebrew emulators. 
  - Can sync games and saves and states for multiple emulators per platform (PS2 on RetroArch and PS5SX2 as an example) using hardlinks.
- **Beautiful and Responsive UI**
  - Based on mihawk-99's Vulkan homebrew apps and BlackBearReloaded's UI kit, we get a nice, responsive feel. So worth it, it looks 1000x better. 15+ different themes to pick from.
- **Background Service**
  - All operations are handled by a backend payload, which means syncing, downloading, and updating keep working in the background, so you can keep **gaming**.
- **RomM API Compliant**
  - RommPS is meant to strictly stick to RomM's API and method of syncing saves and states, ensuring we don't break anything and support RomM's latest features.
- **Secure and Human-Coded**
  - Each release is signed. The payload checks the signature before it updates itself, and ProsperoStore checks every download against the release's checksum. This app was primarily coded by a **human**, and will be frequently updated and maintained. AI was primarily used for explaining concepts, creating documentation, and converting data. Ya know, the tedious stuff.
- **Easter Eggs**
  - Check in the Settings, scroll the settings list, see if you find the X. This **hint** won't be here forever.

## Requirements

- A PS5 running etaHEN or onionHEN, or a PS4 running GoldHEN
- RomM 5.2.0 or newer (may work on older versions)
- Whichever other emulators you want
  
## Install

### PS5

| ProsperoStore | RecompStore |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="/assets/prospero-store-rommps.png" width="300" alt="ProsperoStore Install QR"> | <img src="/assets/recomp-store-rommps.png" width="300" alt="RecompStore Install QR"> |

### Manual Install
Download `PPSA76677.zip` from the releases page, unzip it and copy the `PPSA76677` folder to `/data/homebrew/` on the console. Launch RommPS and it will deploy the background service, and set itself to autostart with etaHen or onionHen. 

If you'd rather run just the payload, without the app:
1. Download the latest `romm-sync.elf` from the releases page.
2. Send it to the console (or use whichever favorite tool you wish):
   ```sh
   nc -w 1 <ps5-ip> 9021 < romm-sync.elf
   ```
3. Set it up at `http://<ps5-ip>:8780` from another device.

### PS4

> **Experimental.** The PS4 is currently considered experimental
Needs GoldHEN 2.4b18.5 or newer, whose payload menu runs ELF payloads.
R
1. Download the latest `romm-sync-ps4.pkg` from the releases page and install it with your package installer.
2. Open **RommPS** from the home screen. It copies its payload, `romm-sync-ps4.elf`, to `/data/payloads/`.
3. In GoldHEN Settings, open the payloader, pick `romm-sync-ps4.elf` and run it. Add it to the AutoRun queue there and it starts on every jailbreak.
4. Open **RommPS** again: it shows the web UI. It's also at `http://<ps4-ip>:8780` from another device.

The app only installs the payload and shows the web UI; the payload does the syncing, in the background, whether or not the app is open. Without the package, copy `romm-sync-ps4.elf` to `/data/payloads/` yourself (GoldHEN's FTP server, or `make install-ps4 PS4_HOST=<ps4-ip>`).

**Note:** Don't send the payload to GoldHEN's network loader on port 9090: GoldHEN 2.4 crashes on ELFs sent there. Make sure the console's date and time are set (GoldHEN can keep them updated), or HTTPS won't work.

### How it runs

RommPS starts with your HEN, and setup turns this on for you. Both HENs start `payloads/romm-sync.elf` when `romm-sync.elf.auto_start` sits next to it, and RommPS puts both in every HEN's folder on the console (`/data/etaHEN/payloads` and `/data/OnionHEN/payloads`), so switching HENs keeps working. If a payload manager like pldmgr has its own copy, that copy is kept up to date too. If you build it yourself, `make install PS5_HOST=<ps5-ip>` copies it over FTP (add `PS5_FTP=ftp://<ps5-ip>:1337 PS5_HEN_DIR=/data/OnionHEN` for onionHEN's FTP plugin).

## Updates

- On the PS5, just update RommPS: from ProsperoStore (or other homebrew storefronts eventually), or by copying the new zip's folder over the old one. The background service comes with it, and RommPS swaps it in the next time you open it, once nothing is syncing or downloading. An older version never replaces a newer one. 
- On the PS4, the payload updates itself from Settings.

## Setup Wizard

The setup wizard walks you through five steps:

1. Connecting to your server.
2. Approving the console in RomM, by scanning a QR code or entering a code.
3. Choosing which emulators to sync.
4. Checking what the first sync will do.
5. Choosing when to sync in the background.

**Back up your saves before the first sync.** Copy your emulator save folders to a computer or USB drive. RommPS keeps a local copy before replacing any file, but your own backup is the safest option.

## Emulators
RommPS has built-in profiles for most known emulators on the PS5, and will set the correct default game, save/save state, and bios directories for them. Since there is a huge influx of new emulators popping up, I will be doing my very best to keep up with them and add profiles accordingly.  

Note: RommPS relies on your emulator **NOT** being sandboxed. Some emulators require a separate payload that must be launched to be able to access outside of the sandbox, so make sure you've followed their instructions to properly install. Sandboxed emulators will not be able to read games or save files.

> The emulators listed below are those I've tested and have created profiles for to auto-detect them. You can also manually set the directories for each emulator/platform via the PS5 app or or the Web UI; you can use whichever emulators you wish.

### PS4

| Emulator | Systems |
| --- | --- |
| RetroArch | The RetroArch systems above, wherever the PS4 build has the core |
| pSNES, pNES, pGEN, pGBA, pFBN | SNES; NES; Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, Sega CD, SG-1000; GBA, GBC, GB; arcade |

### Save states
Some users have recently reported issues with being able to pull down save states from their servers. They don't see them on the destination save folder for that emulator, or if they do, they don't work. Save states typically cannot be used across different emulators (cores), and even within the same core, the definition of a save state may different with the file version, and version of the app. In my opinion, save states should be for quick resume or to save you when you forgot to save your game, so they truly don't need to be synced across devices.

## PS4/PS5 Games

If you are interested in downloading PS4 and PS5 games from your RomM server, RomM has direct FPKGi support, simply add it as a library. This sync client does NOT handle PS4/PS5 save syncing at this time, but is being researched for potential future inclusion.

## Web UI

RommPS exposes a separate Web UI at http://your-ps5-ip:8780 where you can access all the same features present in the native app.

## Emulator Profiles

I've included direct support for most of the emulators that are out right now, except for the ones that won't even launch... you can sync games, states, and saves anywhere you want, but the presets should do it for most people. You can also configure the paths for all platforms manually. The web UI has a JSON editor for emulator profiles.

## Building

```sh
git submodule update --init third_party/sigil && git -C third_party/sigil submodule update --init third_party/tiny-AES-c   # once, after cloning
make host tools       # macOS or Linux build for development, plus tools/release-sign
tools/ps5-build.sh    # PS5 build in Docker, output in build/ps5/
tools/ps4-build.sh    # PS4 payload in Docker, output in build/ps4/
tools/ps4-build.sh ps4-pkg   # plus the PS4 home screen app (platform/ps4/app)
tests/e2e.sh          # end-to-end tests against a mock RomM server
tests/autostart.sh    # autostart, version checks and HEN folders
```

Both consoles build from the same code in `src/`. What differs lives in `platform/<console>/`: `platform.c` (the `src/platform.h` interface), the make rules and the Docker SDK image. `platform/console/` has the parts the PS4 and PS5 share, and `platform/host/` is the development build.

## P.S to the industry

If buying isn't **owning**, then piracy **isn't** stealing. 🖕
